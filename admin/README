Here is a list of tools which you can find inside the admin directory:

-------------------
distmake-builder.py
-------------------

Python script to create all-from-source tarballs for distribution.
The script is interactive, it asks the user some questions (whether to include
documentation, tests, version control, etc). Once all the questions have been
answered, a bash script is generated. This bash script generates a tarball
following the specifications the user gave (the answers to the questions).
This means that you can save the file and use it whenever you want to create
the distribution (without having to re-answer all the questions).

-----------------
svn2hg-transition
-----------------

The scripts which were used to migrate from SVN to Mercurial.
They are not useful anymore, but document how the process was actually done.

--------------
new-release.py
--------------

Script to release a new version of Nmag.
It is an interactive scripts which asks you what it should do and give some
hints about what you are supposed to do in the whole release process.
