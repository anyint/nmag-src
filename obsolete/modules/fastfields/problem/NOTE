It seems as if OCaml's weak hash table feature would not work as
expected. We can cook up examples where we lose entries which do not
seem to be properly finalized (...but Gc.finalise also seems to behave
a bit strange anyway...), but disappear nevertheless from the weak
hash table EVEN THOUGH they are still being referenced!

This is very strange, indeed. Maybe it has to do with us wrapping up
stuff in python pills, but that should not be an issue, actually!
