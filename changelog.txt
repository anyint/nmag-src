Next release 0.2.0 XXXX
=======================

New Features

* Improved handling of command line arguments.
  The parsing of command line arguments now happens at the beginning, before
  the nmag module is imported. Options can be passed to PETSc using the
  --petsc-opts flag (try `nsim -h --petsc-opts -h' to get a list). It is then
  possible to use the logging facilities offered by the library. The
  interactive command `nsim_i' has been removed. Nsim detects when it is
  being used interactively and uses IPython when possible.

* Added a new command Nmagprobe for postprocessing the data. Can probe the
  magnetisation in a cubic lattice in space and time. Can convert the data
  into one or more OOMMF OVF files (both versions 1.0 and 2.0 are supported)
  and these files can be reloaded with OOMMF, for example. Can Fourier
  transform the data (in space, time or both) to obtain dispersion curves or
  the modes of the system.

* Partial PBC support for HLib. HLib can now be used together with PBC.
  Downside: the size of the HLib matrix increases with the number of copies.
  For a sufficiently large number of copies (typically 1000 or more), using
  PBC+HLib may not give any benefits with respect to PBC alone.

Bugfixes/Improvements

* Adjusted flags in compilation Makefile.
  PETSc compiled --with-debugging=no (~10 % speed improvement). Stopping
  when HLib compilation fails.

* Optimisation of mesh module: topology information generated only on demand,
  mesh datastructures re-engineered to occupy less memory. As a consequence
  a medium-large simulation requires less memory (reduction of 10-20 % of the
  non-BEM part) and is faster in the initialisation phase (about the same
  amount).

* Added a bug report script to collect compilation logs into a single file.
  That should considerably simplify the submission of bug reports.

* Updated packages to latest stable release in the compile from source.
  We are now using: Mpich2 1.2.1p1, Petsc 3.1-p5, Ocaml 3.12.0, Findlib 1.2.1,
  Gsl 1.14, Parmetis 3.1.1, NumPy 1.5

* Added support for Numpy array to pass data to the core simulation engine
  (makes it faster to set and retrieve fields)

* Fixed bug when reloading data from an MPI simulation with different number
  of node with respect to the one which saved the data (data is now reordered
  when loading it, if necessary)

* Reworked build system. All Nmag OCaml sources are now in one single directory
  which makes it easy to configure and build the nsim executable.

* Native compilation on Ubuntu 11.10 should now be possibe
  and relatively straightforward.

* Rewrote the test system and fixed bugs.

* Ported the documentation to Sphinx.


Release 0.1 beta (6481) 22 December 2009
========================================

New Features

* Support of Hierarchical Matrix compression for Boundary element matrix. See
  example in documentation for details, and `Knittel et al 105, 07D542 (2009)
  <http://link.aip.org/link/?JAPIAU/105/07D542/1>`__, `postprint pdf
  <http://www.soton.ac.uk/~fangohr/publications/postprint/Knittel_etal_JAP_105_07D542_2009.pdf>`__). 

Bugfixes/Improvements

* Minor improvements manual (Example 1 and 2, nmagpp, mayavi, 6170, updated MPI section)

* Updated plot.dat and plots for Example Hysteresis loop for thin disk to fix
  documentation bug (thanks to Weiwei Wang for spotting this, 6326).

* The time stopping criteria are now more faithfully respected. A new optional
  argument, 'exact_tstop', has been added to 'Simulation.advance_time' and to
  'Simulation.set_params' to give more freedom to the time integrator, in case
  performance is a concern and exact time-stopping is not really needed.

* Updated packages to their latest stable release in the compile from source.
  We are now using: Sundials 2.3.0, HDF5 1.6.10, Python 2.6.4, pytables 2.1.2,
  NumPy 1.3.0, IPython 0.10. 

* The regression tests can now be called with three different targets (6430):

  make check : runs all fast tests (should complete in less than 5
  minutes). This is a good test to run after compiling nmag (from source).

  make checkmpi   : runs mpi-related checks

  make checkslow  : runs tests that take longer (order of hours)

  make checkall   : run all tests together  

  (Previously, the mpi tests were part of target 'check'.)

----------------------------------

Interface changes;

* We stop providing a Debian package for this release. The from source
  compile works out of the box on Deian systems.


Release 0.1 beta (6163) 30 March 2009
=====================================

Bugfixes:

* Fixed bug that resulted in simulation hanging when running in MPI
  mode (6039)

* Solved error in regression test (test_gmsh1_0_import.py). The error
  was in the test code, not in the conversion code. (5987)


New Features:

* New functionality: Zhang-Li spin torque coupling term for uniform
  current densities added and documented. (6133)

Improvements:

* Reduced memory footprint (by approx 7% for the problem in manual/example2) 
  (6098)

* Documented ``load_m_from_h5file`` (6041) and ``save_restart_file`` (6096)

* Document LLG equation of motion (new subsection in section
  Background), and llg_gamma_G parameter in MagMaterials (6014)

* Added more ``save=`` usage examples for hysteresis() and relax()
  functions (6096) in documentation of hysteresis command.

* Added MPI-regression tests (6031)

* tidied up file tree (removing out-dated examples, etc) (6059)

* Added mpi debug function nmag.mpi_hello() (6068)

* Allow to switch on debug messages from slaves (usually switched off) 
  using --slavelog

* Adding release date to output of nsimversion (6153)

Interface change:

* Configuration files (RUNID_*.conf) are now only written when the
  --dumpconf switch is provided (6093)


Release 0.1 beta (5962) 20 November 2008
========================================

Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
----------------------------------

* New feature: Can read finite element meshes produced with Gmsh using
  the new ``--gmsh`` switch for the ``nmeshimport`` tool. (5924)

* Added more regression tests

* Fixed bug that stopped simulations where two magnetic domains touch
  each other (5886)

* Fixed bug that didn't allow to have different (potentially
  unrelated) simulation objects in the same nmag-program (5956)

* Fixed bug that (sometimes) stopped the --restart mechanism 
  to continue interrupted hysteresis loop calculations (5907)

* Fixed bug that prevented ``sim.get_subfield_positions`` and
  ``sim.get_subfield_sites()`` from working. (5933)



Release 0.1 beta (5878) 13 October 2009
=======================================

Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
----------------------------------

* bugfix: reinitialisation used to reset the stage_time and stage_step
  counters. This is now fixed and is done explicitly in the hysteresis method.
  This functionality is needed to study systems where the applied field
  changes in time (5848).

* bugfix: allow from source compilation on (K)Ubuntu 8.04. The bug is
  with the Petsc library 2.3.2. We have upgraded the Petsc library to
  2.3.3 in the compile from source installation, which resolves the
  problem (5851). 

* bugfix: reading Gambit meshes works without warnings (5852).

* bugfix: A missing ``.petsc`` file in the user's home directory
  resulted in an error message when nsim was started. This did create
  the missing file, so all is fine the next time nsim is
  called. Revision (5853) fixes this.

* Improvement: Split hysteresis example in tutorial into two
  examples. The first can be used to play around with thecommand andto
  quickly complete a simulation. The second allows to compare the
  resulting hysteresis loop with an analytical prediction (5876).

* minor improvements in makefile for installation from source (5859).



Release 0.1 beta (5787) 2 September 2008
========================================

Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
----------------------------------

* bugfix: disabled diagnostic debug code that caused segfault for large meshes
  (over 130,000 volume elements)

* bugfix: including documentation for
  Simulation.get_subfield_average() in manual

* nmeshipmort has slightly improved error reporting when attempting to
  import an unknown mesh format



Release 0.1 beta (5787) 8 August 2008
=====================================

Bugfixes/Improvements/New Features
----------------------------------

* We have a new distribution mode using VMWare's vmplayer. This is
  particularly attractive to MS Windows users. This is at a very early
  stage and and we invite feedback from early adaptors.

* Updated the Knoppix CD to the most recent version, and to include the 
  Netgen mesh generator.

* ncol can now process OOMMF's odt files (use --odt switch)

* Bugfix: the previous debian package could only execute on CPUs with sse2 extension.

* Bugfix: fixed	embarrassing bug that appeared with the last release
  (printing of applied field brakes when first component is zero).

Interface change
----------------

* removed support for thermal fluctuations. There appeared to be no
  up-take of this feature, and maintaining this (while developing the
  code further, parallelising it and making faster and leaner) was
  unnecessarily binding resources.



Release 0.1 beta (5734) 1 August 2008
=====================================


Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features
-----------------------------------

* Reduced memory requirements by approximately 20% (due to better
  compression of sparse matrices)

* Updated code working with hdf5 files to be compatible with pytables
  version 1 and 2 (no immediate effect on user if using compile from
  source, but allows to link to existing pytables2). By default we
  are still using pytables1 (but expect to switch at some point in the
  future, which should be transparent to users).
  
* Change from numpy 1.0.1 to 1.1.0. in compile from source distribution.

* More detailed progress reporting in nmagpp (useful if data files
  become large, i.e. a GB and more).

* More detailed progress report in setup phase.

* More detailed progress reporting in hysterises/relax commands.

* Made compile from source work for Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard)

* Introduced unit and regression tests.



Release 0.1 beta (5531) 2 June 2008
===================================

Bug fixes/Improvements/New Features
-----------------------------------

* The current release, distribution mode, svn release number and
  location of the nmag-python libraries are provided (to stdout and
  logfile) when a simulation object is created. 

* Re-designed and implemented calculation of the Jacobi matrix: The
  new approach 

  - slightly more computation time is spent during the main simulation
    whenever the Jacobian needs to be re-computed

  - the setup phase takes (notably) less time.

  - simulations with the new approach need about 30% less memory 

* Matrix setup is now parallised.

* Documented the use of MPI in the manual to carry out parallel runs.

* Bugfix: Code now working with MPICH2.

* Bugfix: The compilation from source works (again) for Mac OS X.

* Switched to pvode (the parallel solver for time integration) by default.
  Updated timestepper tolerances section accordingly.

* Feature enhancement: can save spatially resolved fields using the
  save_data command in any order (previsouly, it was possible to stick
  to the same set of saved fields for every saved timestep). 

* Update of manual in several places (including recommendation how to
  cite nmag in FAQ).

* A number of (smaller) bugfixes.

  
Interface changes
-----------------

* The use of ``row`` for the analyses of nmag's ``_dat.h5`` data files
  has been superseeded with the use of ``id``s (see explanation in
  manual).

  This has the following side effect: the nmagpp command labels vtk
  file using the mask NAME-00XX.vtk where XX is an increasing
  number. This used to be the 'row' number for saved fields. Because
  it is now possible to save any fields in any order, the value of XX
  is now replaced with the unique id of a saved configuration. This
  also allows easier identification of a saved configuration with an
  entry in the ndt file (via the id).

* nmagpp used to have a switch ``--field`` which allowed to choose
  *one* field that should be dumped (``--dump``) or converted to vtk
  files (``--vtk``). The functionality has now been extended so that
  *a list of fields* can be given, such as ``nmagpp --fields
  m,phi,H_demag --vtk myvtkfiles.vtk
  mysimulation_dat.h5``. Consequently, the switch has been renamed
  from ``--field`` to ``--fields``.



Release 0.1 beta (5259) 30 January 2008
=======================================

Bug fixes/Improvements
----------------------

* changed for parallel execution to use of pvode (rather than cvode
  before). Results in performance increase for MPI runs.

Interface changes
-----------------

* None



New features
------------

None



Release 0.1 beta (5259) 30 January 2008
=======================================

Bug fixes/Improvements
----------------------

* ticket 126: Calculation of exchange energy, demag energy, Zeeman
  energy and total energy had wrong sign; now working correctly.

* increased speed of setup phase slightly.


Interface changes
-----------------

* Have changed version of mpich in tarball distribution. Used to be
  mpich2.0 but is mpich1.0 from now on (to be consistent with debian
  packages). Users who have older tarballs and want to use MPI
  execution, need to obtain a new tarball to update (updating the
  nsim-core is not sufficient).


New features
------------

None



Release 0.1 beta (4947) 20 December 2007
========================================

Bug fixes/Improvements
----------------------
* ticket 101: Setting anisotropy=nmag.uniaxial_anisotropy(K1=0) in MagMaterial
  produces an error message;
* ticket 103: When starting from a zero torque configuration the simulation
  proceeds up to the maximum time (which is 1 s) and here it stops:
  now an appropriate error message is displayed.
* ticket 97: Unrecognized architecture causes compilation failure in the
  bem3d module: now the architecture flag will be empty if the architecture
  detection fails.
* changeset:4919 reduced setup time by approx 1/3 through faster setup
  of operators (apart from H_exch and Jabobi). Further speed up reduces setup time
  to half the original value.
* new section on sundials tolerances in manual guided tour.

Interface changes
-----------------

None.


New features
------------

* Writing sundials performance data in log file (_cvode.log)

* added setting of CVODE tolerances as function of stopping_dm_dt
  (needs to be tested and documented), currently switched off by
  default.



Release 0.1 beta (4785) 27 November 2007
========================================

----------------------

* improved renderening of bitmaps (figures and equations) in html
  documentation (4754)

* install from tar ball was broken (pkgs in wrong directory)


Interface changes
-----------------


New features
------------

* added mini tutorial on micromagnetic simulations to manual

* new tool nmeshsort
