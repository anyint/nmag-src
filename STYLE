Introduction
============

This document describe the stylistic choices which the Nsim developers are
trying to follow.

LOCAL(STATIC) FUNCTIONS AND OBJECTS: we encourage the usage of the prefix
my_ to embed in the name of functions and objects the fact that they are
meant to be local and are not exposed outside of the current module/file.

ABSTRACT TYPES: types should be abstract when possible, and we should use
methods to access the fields. That also prevents the name scoping problem
of OCaml (i.e. two structures cannot have members with the same name).


Abbreviations used in the code

LAM: Linear Algebra Machine
CCPLA: Centrally Coordinated Parallel Linear Algebra
